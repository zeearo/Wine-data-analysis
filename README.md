# Wine-data-analysis
# r script
In this data science project, we worked on a highly distributed Multivariate dataset. With help of various functions we analyzed our dataset’s component, how the alcohol level and other measures of wines from each winery re distributed, their frequency, count etc. due to high correlation between the dataset, we used PCA model to reduce their dimensionality and then plot its graph and at last predicted the values. I used SVM model for classification and it has given me an accuracy of 100 % on the test set and it could be seen in confusion matrix.
I can use other classification models like naïve bayes alse and similarly other dimension reduction models like lda or kernel PCA instead of PCA.
